# Building Voice Agents with OpenAI

Workshop at AI Engineer World's Fair 2025

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer with npm installed.

  We will use Node.js for a consistent experience for all attendees but `bun` and `deno` are supported by the SDK.

- An OpenAI account with an OpenAI API key stored as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- A Mem0 AI account with an API key stored as `MEM_API_KEY` environment variable

## Setup

Clone this repository to have access to the boilerplate code for our workshop

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dkundel-openai/aie-voice-agents-workshop.git
cd aie-voice-agents-workshop
npm install
```

This will automatically install the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js), [`zod`](https://zod.dev), [`mem0ai`](https://mem0.ai) and TypeScript for you.

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
export MEM_API_KEY=your_MEM_API_key_here
```

## Project structure

During the workshop we will use two projects.

We will start off in [01-basic](01-basic/) where we will create a basic text-based agent to familiarize yourself with the [OpenAI Agents SDK for TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/).

Afterwards we will use the Next.js app in [02-voice](02-voice/) to build our voice agent using the same SDK. We'll be using Next.js to have a framework where we can have both server-side code and client-code easily accessible but the SDK is compatible with any frontend framework.

## Running your code

### 01-basic

The following command will execute your `index.ts` file:

```bash
npm run start:01
```

### 02-voice

The following command will start up the development server for your Next.js app:

```bash
npm run start:02
```
